I'm doing my PhD in Statistics at the University of Waterloo. My current research is on dataset distillation: the process of creating tiny synthetic datasets that contain all the knowledge of much larger datasets. Before that, I worked on making safety-critical systems like cars and drones safer by using deep learning to restore lost sensor data.
