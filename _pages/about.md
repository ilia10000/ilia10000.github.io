I'm a Faculty Fellow/Assistant Professor at the NYU Center for Data Science. 

Before that, I was a postdoc in the CoCoSci Lab at Princeton University supervised by Dr. Tom Griffiths.

And before that, I did my PhD in Statistics at the University of Waterloo where I defended my thesis on 'Learning From Almost No Data' supervised by Dr. Matthias Schonlau. 

I use tools like [representational alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13018) to study the parallels between human and artificial intelligence in order to probe the [limits of learning/teaching with small data](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/e8ddc03b001d4c4b44b29bc1167e7fdd-Abstract-Conference.html) and develop AI thought partners that [learn & think *with* people rather than *instead of* people](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03943).

Check out my publications to see my progress so far. If you find something you're interested in discussing then shoot me an email and I'd be happy to chat. The best place to reach me is at <is3060 [at] nyu [dot] edu>.
